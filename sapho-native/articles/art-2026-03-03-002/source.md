Abstract.
Agentic coding tools receive goals written in natural language as input, break them down into specific tasks, and write or execute the actual code with minimal human intervention. Central to this process are agent context files (“READMEs for agents”) that provide persistent, project-level instructions. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 2,303 agent context files from 1,925 repositories to characterize their structure, maintenance, and content. We find that these files are not static documentation but complex, difficult-to-read artifacts that evolve like configuration code, maintained through frequent, small additions. Our content analysis of 16 instruction types shows that developers prioritize functional context, such as build and run commands (62.3%), implementation details (69.9%), and architecture (67.7%). We also identify a significant gap: non-functional requirements like security (14.5%) and performance (14.5%) are rarely specified. These findings indicate that while developers use context files to make agents functional, they provide few guardrails to ensure that agent-written code is secure or performant, highlighting the need for improved tooling and practices.

1. Introduction
“The hottest new programming language is English.”
— Andrej Karpathy (Founding member of OpenAI)
Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software development from editing code by hand to instructing Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents in natural language (Hassan et al., 2025 ; Li et al., 2025b ) .
This novel approach, termed Agentic Coding , interprets natural language goals, decomposes them into subtasks, and autonomously plans and writes code with minimal human intervention. However, the autonomy of these agents hinges on a critical, often overlooked factor: context . For an agent to work for a software project, adhere to architectural patterns, and follow team conventions, it requires not only access to source code but also explicit guidance. The effectiveness and safety of this workflow depend not only on model quality but also on how projects communicate their architecture, constraints, and conventions to these agents.
To address this, a new class of software artifact has emerged: agent context files . These are specialized files ( e.g., AGENTS.md ) that work like a README for agents 1 1 1 https://agents.md and define how the agent should behave within a given software project. These documents specify project-specific knowledge, architectural overviews, build and test commands, coding conventions, and explicit rules for interacting with tools and external services. They define the agent’s role, describe the system architecture, record build and test commands, and encode coding standards and operational rules. Modern coding tools such as Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot load these files at the start of a session and use them as persistent context when planning and executing changes. In practice, the quality of these agent context files largely determines how well an agent can understand a repository, follow team practices, and perform non-trivial maintenance tasks.
Prior work on LLM-assisted software engineering has focused on model capabilities, interaction patterns, and immediate prompts, for example, code generation (Jin et al., 2024 ; Hai et al., 2025 ) , automatic program repair (Zhang et al., 2024b ; Xia et al., 2022 ; Bouzenia et al., 2024 ) , and multi-agent collaboration (Zhang et al., 2024a ) . Researchers have also begun to study context engineering (Shin et al., 2023 ; Hai et al., 2025 ) and prompt management in software repositories (Li et al., 2025a ; Shrivastava et al., 2022 ) . However, the concrete artifacts that teams are already using in the wild to steer coding agents (namely agent context files) remain underexplored. Official tool documentation gives only high-level guidance ( e.g., “describe architecture and workflows”), leaving developers to design these manifests by trial and error. We currently lack basic empirical evidence about what these files look like, how they evolve over time, and what instructions they actually contain.
To bridge this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of agent context files. Building on our prior work (Chatlatanagulchai et al., 2025 ) which studied 253 context files for Claude Code, we extend the scope to 2,303 context files from 1,925 repositories across three agentic coding tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot. We aim to uncover the structural patterns, maintenance habits, and instructional strategies that developers currently employ. Our study focuses on these research questions (RQs):
R ​ Q 1 RQ_{1} : What are the characteristics of agent context files?
Understanding readability and structure is essential for creating maintainable agent configurations. Agent context files are generally long and difficult to read, yet follow a consistent shallow hierarchy with a single top-level heading and most content organized under H2 and H3 sections.
R ​ Q 2 RQ_{2} : How often do developers maintain agent context files?
It is unclear whether agent context files behave like static documentation or like evolving configuration in the codebase. Agent context files are actively maintained in short bursts, evolving through incremental additions rather than deletions, behaving as living configuration artifacts rather than static documents.
R ​ Q 3 RQ_{3} : What instructions are included in agent context files?
Identifying what context developers prioritize reveals the current focus and blind spots of agentic coding in real-world projects. Instructions are heavily skewed toward functional operations ( e.g., Build and Run , Implementation Details ), while critical non-functional requirements like Security and Performance are rare.
R ​ Q 4 RQ_{4} : To what extent can instructions in agent context files be classified automatically?
Manual analysis of agent context files content is unscalable, making it critical to understand if this classification can be automated for future monitoring. Automatic classification is highly effective (0.79 F1-score) for concrete functional topics ( e.g., Testing and Architecture ), but it struggles with abstract or nuanced topics ( e.g., Maintenance ).

Paper Structure. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the motivating examples. Section 3 details our study design, data collection, and analysis methodology. Section 4 reports the empirical findings. Section 5 summarizes the key insights and discusses the implications of our study. Section 6 reviews related work. Section 7 outlines threats to validity, and Section 8 concludes the paper.
2. Motivating Examples
Agentic coding tools can be configured through specialized Markdown files that define how AI coding assistants should operate within specific projects. Common examples include CLAUDE.md for Claude Code or AGENTS.md for OpenAI Codex. We refer to these artifacts as Agent Context Files . Agent context files serve as a persistent long-term memory for the agent. By documenting project-specific context such as architectural patterns, testing commands, and coding conventions, these files spare developers from repeatedly explaining the same rules in each session. When stored in version control, they help the AI maintain a consistent understanding of the project’s requirements, even as the codebase evolves.
Figure 1 . Example of agent context files
The structure and content of agent context files vary significantly across projects, reflecting diverse development needs and practices. Consider two real-world examples that illustrate this diversity. A web framework project (shown in Figure 1 ) contains a minimal AGENTS.md file of just 20 lines with 3 sections, providing basic instructions about running commands, code style, and directory structure. In contrast, an agent-tool development project could feature a comprehensive 329-line file with 74 distinct sections, covering project overview, architecture, development workflow, security and performance considerations, testing strategy, etc. 3 3 3 https://github.com/antimetal/system-agent/blob/3552a87720e0e16a9c05681b1e549c9a73921ade/CLAUDE.md These examples demonstrate that agent context files are not standardized or template documents but rather adaptable configuration mechanisms that developers customize based on project complexity, team size, and domain-specific requirements.
Despite their importance, official documentation for agent context files remains limited. For example, the official documents of Claude Code indicate only that agent context files can be used to share instructions for the project, such as project architecture, coding standards, and common workflows. This fragmentation and lack of explicit, standardized guidance can delay developers’ ability to effectively define and leverage the agent’s behavior, creating a substantial barrier to exploiting the full potential of agentic coding and potentially leading to inconsistencies in agent performance and a steeper learning curve for integration. Consequently, this gap in practical guidance for the creation of agent context files served as a primary motivation for our current research. We aim to address this challenge by systematically investigating existing Claude Code files within open-source repositories. Our study is specifically designed to infer common structural patterns, typical instructions, and general practices in how developers configure and maintain these crucial agent context files files.
3. Methodology
Figure 2 . Overview of our methodology.
To expand upon our previous work (Chatlatanagulchai et al., 2025 ) , this study systematically collects and analyzes agent context files from open-source repositories for three agentic coding tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot. Figure 2 illustrates the data collection pipeline.
We identify repositories that use agentic coding tools through the AIDev dataset (Li et al., 2025b ) , which provides a curated list of repositories where agentic coding tools contribute to development. From this dataset, we select 8,370 repositories with at least 5 GitHub stars to exclude toy projects. We then use GitHub API 4 4 4 https://docs.github.com/en/rest to scan the root directory of each selected repository. For each agentic coding tool, we retrieve files whose filenames follow the official naming convention in that agent’s documentation: we search for CLAUDE.md , AGENTS.md , and copilot-instructions.md in these repositories, using case-insensitive filename matching. In total, we collect 922 Claude Code files, 694 OpenAI Codex files, and 687 GitHub Copilot files across 1,925 repositories. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of their hosting repositories, including their median stars, median forks, and the average number of days from repository creation until the first adoption of agent context files.

4. Results
In this section, we provide the motivation, approach, and findings for each of our research questions (RQs).
4.1. R ​ Q 1 RQ_{1} : What are the characteristics of agent context files?
4.1.1. Motivation.
Agent context files serve as the initial instructions an agent reads before execution. Understanding their characteristics (such as size, readability, and organizational structure) in real-world projects is crucial for helping developers write effective agent context files. These attributes, much like in traditional software artifacts, directly impact usability, maintainability, and clarity. For instance, context file size and the amount of context provided can correlate with task performance and computational cost (Liu et al., 2025 ) . Readability is also critical: instructions that are hard to read can be misunderstood by agents or incorrectly modified by developers, leading to unintended behavior (Piantadosi et al., 2020 ) . For example, higher readability has been associated with better outcomes in issue resolution tasks (Ehsani et al., 2025 ) .
Prior work on traditional software documentation shows that developer-focused documents typically employ hierarchical section structures (Treude et al., 2015 ) . Empirical studies of project documentation ( e.g., README files) also find that early versions tend to be minimal, focusing on basic usage (Gaughan et al., 2025 ) . However, agent context files such as CLAUDE.md are a new class of documentation designed specifically for coding agents. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has systematically analyzed the structural characteristics of agent context files ( e.g., how many levels of instructions they contain). We therefore investigate not only their size and readability, but also their organizational patterns.

We analyze three aspects of agent context files: size, readability, and structural organization. Context files size is measured by counting words using the regular expression “\w+”. This pattern matches maximal sequences of word characters (letters, digits, and underscores), and each match is treated as a single word token. Readability is measured with the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) metric, following prior work on LLM-related texts (Ehsani et al., 2025 ; Cañizares et al., 2024 ) . Table 2 summarizes the interpretation of FRE scores, where higher values indicate easier text. To capture organizational structure, we extract each Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI Codex file from the cloned repositories and count Markdown headers at each level from H1 ( i.e., # ) to H5 ( i.e., ##### ). This yields the depth and distribution of sections within these agent context files.
To identify statistically significant differences across coding agents, we perform the Mann-Whitney U test (Mann and Whitney, 1947 ) at a significance level of α = 0.05 \alpha=0.05 . We compute Cliff’s delta d d (Long et al., 2003 ) effect size to quantify the difference based on the following thresholds (Romano et al., 2006 ) :
(1)
Effect ​ size = { n ​ e ​ g ​ l ​ i ​ g ​ i ​ b ​ l ​ e , if ​ | d | ≤ 0.147 s ​ m ​ a ​ l ​ l , if ​ 0.147 < | d | ≤ 0.33 m ​ e ​ d ​ i ​ u ​ m , if ​ 0.33 < | d | ≤ 0.474 l ​ a ​ r ​ g ​ e , if ​ 0.474 < | d | ≤ 1 \mathrm{Effect\ size}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}negligible,&\mathrm{if}\ |d|\leq 0.147\\

medium,&\mathrm{if}\ 0.33<|d|\leq 0.474\\
large,&\mathrm{if}\ 0.474<|d|\leq 1\\
\end{array}\right.

4.1.3. Findings.
Agent context files for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are substantially longer than those for OpenAI Codex. As illustrated in Figure 3(a) , context files for GitHub Copilot (median 535.0 words) and Claude Code (median 485.0 words) are similarly extensive, with no statistically significant difference in length. However, both are significantly longer than OpenAI Codex context files (median 335.5 words), a difference confirmed to be statistically significant with a small effect size (Cliff’s delta d = 0.21 d=0.21 and d = 0.22 d=0.22 , respectively). This larger volume of instruction suggests that developers using Claude Code and GitHub Copilot may incur higher computational costs or token penalties.
Agent context files are generally difficult to read, with Claude Code the hardest and OpenAI Codex the easiest.
Figure 3(b) shows that Claude Code context files are the most difficult to read, with a median FRE score of 16.6. This places them in the “very difficult” category, typical of dense academic or legal documents (see Table 2 ). GitHub Copilot context files, while also “very difficult” (median FRE 26.6) to read, are nonetheless significantly easier to read than Claude Code’s with a small effect size ( d = 0.24 d=0.24 ). OpenAI Codex context files are the easiest to read of the group, with a median FRE score of 39.6 (“difficult”), which is significantly easier to read than both Claude Code’s (medium effect size) and GitHub Copilot’s (small effect size).
Figure 4 . Distribution of agent context files’s Headers
Agent context files follow a consistent, shallow hierarchy centered on a single top-level heading with most structure at H2 and H3. Figure 4 shows that the structure is almost always a single, top-level H1 heading, with a median count of 1.0 for all context files (with no statistically significant difference), suggesting developers treat each file as a unified document. From this primary heading, the context files branch into a moderate number of H2 headings (median 6 to 7) to define major topics. While all context files follow this pattern, GitHub Copilot and Claude Code context files provide significantly more granular detail through a greater number of H3 and H4 sub-sections compared to OpenAI Codex. For example, at the H3 level, GitHub Copilot (median 12.0) and Claude Code (median 11.0) are significantly more detailed than OpenAI Codex (median 9.0), with these differences being statistically significant with a small effect size ( d = 0.15 d=0.15 and d = 0.17 d=0.17 , respectively).
Deeper levels are uncommon. At the H4 level, Claude Code (median 5.0) is also statistically significantly more granular than GitHub Copilot (median 4.0), though the effect size remains small ( d = 0.17 d=0.17 ). Despite these differences in granularity, the preference for a shallow hierarchy is universal. Deeply nested structures (H5 and beyond) are extremely rare. For example, H5 headers appear in only 6 Claude Code files and H6 headers are non-existent, with no significant difference in their infrequent use. This common structural template: a single H1, several H2s, and some H3s or H4s, likely makes the context files easier for developers to quickly parse, modify, and maintain.
4.2. R ​ Q 2 RQ_{2} : How often do developers maintain agent context files?
4.2.1. Motivation.
Prior empirical studies consistently show that traditional software documentation ( e.g., README files) is maintained far less actively than source code (Gao et al., 2025 ; Gaughan et al., 2025 ) . Such documentation is often created early in a project’s lifecycle and then receives only minor or infrequent updates, often limited to formatting or link corrections (Ferreira et al., 2021 ) . However, prior work has focused on general-purpose documentation written for humans. Agent context files such as CLAUDE.md serve a different purpose: they function as operational configurations for AI coding agents and directly influence how these agents behave in the development workflow. It is unclear whether developers treat them like traditional documentation or as live configuration artifacts that evolve alongside the code. This RQ investigates how often developers modify these context files and how intensive that maintenance is over time, to determine whether they exhibit the same maintenance inertia as traditional documentation or follow a more active and dynamic evolution.
4.2.2. Approach.
To study the maintenance of agent context files, we analyze their commit histories in the cloned repositories from our dataset. For each repository, we identify all commits in which at least one agent context files ( CLAUDE.md , AGENTS.md , or copilot-instructions.md ) is added, deleted, or modified. For every such commit, we extract (i) the timestamp and (ii) the number of lines added and deleted. We then aggregate these per-commit measurements to compute the total number of commits that touch it and the time intervals between consecutive file-related commits. This yields 5,655 commits for Claude Code, 2,767 commits for OpenAI Codex, and 2,237 commits for GitHub Copilot. Finally, we compare the distributions of commit counts, inter-commit intervals, and added/deleted lines across the three coding agents using Mann-Whitney U with Cliff’s delta (same as Section 4.1 ), to assess whether the context files for different agents follow distinct maintenance patterns.
4.2.3. Findings.
(a) Commit counts
(b) Commit interval
Figure 5 . Distribution of agent context files commit activities.
Agent context files are actively maintained and rarely behave as static documentation.
Figure 5(a) shows that a majority of Claude Code context files (67.4%) are modified in multiple commits, indicating that they are routinely revisited and refined rather than being written once and forgotten. This pattern also holds, though slightly less frequent, for GitHub Copilot (59.7%) and OpenAI Codex (59.2%). The results of Mann-Whitney U test show that Claude Code context files receive significantly more commits than both GitHub Copilot (with a medium effect size where d = 0.35 d=0.35 ) and OpenAI Codex (with a small effect size where d = 0.15 d=0.15 ). In addition, OpenAI Codex context files are updated more often than GitHub Copilot with a small effect size ( d = 0.18 d=0.18 ). Overall, agent context files behave as evolving configuration artifacts and not as static instructions.
Maintainers update agent context files in short bursts.
Figure 5(b) shows that the median interval is 70.7 hours (around 3 days) for GitHub Copilot, 24.1 hours (around 1 day) for Claude Code, and 22.0 hours (around 1 day) for OpenAI Codex. To statistically validate these variations, we applied the Mann-Whitney U test and Cliff’s delta for effect size. The results confirm that the update interval distributions differ significantly across all compared pairs ( p < 0.001 p<0.001 ). The disparity is most pronounced between GitHub Copilot and Claude Code, which exhibits a medium effect size ( d = 0.37 d=0.37 ). In contrast, comparisons involving the general agents dataset show small effect sizes against both GitHub Copilot ( d = − 0.21 d=-0.21 ) and Claude Code ( d = 0.17 d=0.17 ).
Figure 6 . Distribution of the number of deleted lines and added lines in agent context files.
Manifest evolution is driven by small, incremental additions, while deletions are minimal.
Figure 6 show that deletions are consistently negligible across all context file types, with median values less than 15.0 words. In contrast, additions are more substantial and variable. Claude Code updates tend to be the most substantial, with a median of 57.0 words added per commit. This is significantly more words than OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot, although the effect size is negligible.
4.3. R ​ Q 3 RQ_{3} : What instructions are included in agent context files?
4.3.1. Motivation.
Prior work shows that clear, structured instructions, such as stepwise task descriptions or templated formats, significantly improve LLM-generated outputs (Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023 ) , with performance fundamentally shaped by the contextual information provided (Min et al., 2022 ) . Despite this, there is little empirical research on agent context files intended to configure and guide AI agents. RQ2 addresses this by identifying prevalent instruction patterns in these manifests, revealing how developers structure context to align AI behavior in practice.
4.3.2. Approach.
We adopted a two-stage manual content classification approach comprising a label creation phase followed by a label assignment phase. This separation was necessary due to the extensive structure and diversity of instructional content in Claude Code, which made simultaneous label generation and assignment impractical.
In the first phase, we focused on constructing a robust and comprehensive label set. We began by extracting all the H1 and H2 titles from the Claude Code files. Subsequently, we prompted three popular large language models (LLMs), Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5, to generate candidate labels. One of the authors then selected the most appropriate label from these suggestions or created a new label when none were suitable. The use of LLMs was motivated by findings from prior research (Ahmed et al., 2025 ) , which demonstrated that recent LLMs perform comparably to human annotators in manual labeling tasks while significantly reducing effort.
To ensure label quality, two authors independently reviewed the initial label set. This process yielded 80 distinct labels. In the final step, three inspectors collaboratively refined the label set by merging semantically similar entries, resulting in a consolidated set of 16 core labels.
In the second phase, two inspectors assigned the labels generated in the first phase to each Claude Code file, allowing multiple labels per file. Initially, both inspectors independently labeled the content of each file. This process resulted in 2,227 total label assignments across the 332 files, with 438 instances of disagreement (80.3% of agreement rate). To resolve these conflicts, a third inspector joined the discussion and collaborated with the initial two to reach a consensus on the final labels. This conciliation process results in a total of 2,069 labels.
All three inspectors involved in the labeling process have programming experience ranging from 4 to 17 years.

4.3.3. Findings.
The manual classification process identified 16 distinct categories of agent context files.
Table 3 presents the distribution of documentation categories, where percentages indicate the proportion of Claude Code files containing instructions for each category. We identified 16 distinct labels, including two new categories (Maintenance and Debugging) beyond those in our previous work (Chatlatanagulchai et al., 2025 ) . These additions were necessary to classify cases that did not fit existing categories.
When looking into the table, the most prevalent was Build and Run (62.3%), containing command-line instructions, scripts, and procedures for compiling and running code. This was followed by Implementation Details (69.9%) with development guidance ( e.g., code style) and Architecture (67.7%) describing high-level system design.
While the most prevalent instructions ( Build and Run , Implementation Details , Architecture , Testing ) address functional aspects, meta-level or non-functional categories like Performance (14.5%), Security (14.5%), and UI/UX (8.7%) appear far less frequently. This pattern suggests that manifests are primarily optimized to help agents execute and maintain code efficiently rather than address broader quality attributes or user-facing aspects.
Beyond functional factors, we observed notable instances where developers provide contextual information. For example, half of the Claude Code files contain system overview explanations ( i.e., System Overview ). Additionally, 24.4% of manifests ( i.e., AI Integration label) explicitly define the agent’s role and describe its responsibilities within the project ( e.g., reviewers). This indicates that manifests serve not only as technical guides but also as means of establishing an AI agent’s understanding, responsibilities, and collaborative alignment.
Below, we describe each category in detail and introduce a representative example.

4.4. R ​ Q 4 RQ_{4} : To what extent can instructions in agent context files be classified automatically?
4.4.1. Motivation.
The manual content analysis in Section 4.3 provides a detailed taxonomy of instructions in agent context files, but manual qualitative coding is inherently labor-intensive and not scalable. As the adoption of agentic coding tools accelerates, the volume of agent context files will grow, making manual inspection a bottleneck for monitoring ecosystem-wide trends. For example, researchers and practitioners need to track emerging practices or detect gaps in security or testing guidance. Recent work suggests that LLMs can effectively perform classification tasks typically reserved for human annotators (Ahmed et al., 2025 ) . Therefore, to enable future large-scale monitoring of how developers configure agents, we investigate whether the classification of agent context files can be automated.
4.4.2. Approach.
We frame the problem as a multi-label classification task over the 16 categories from Section 4.3 (Table 3 ). We leverage GPT-5 to automatically classify the content of each CLAUDE.md file in the manually labeled subset (332 files). The model is tasked with a multi-label binary classification problem, and we construct a prompt that contains (i) the full context file content and (ii) a concise description and representative examples for each category. The full prompt is available in our replication package. To evaluate performance, we compare the model’s predictions against the ground-truth labels established in Section 4.3 . We compute precision, recall, and F1-score per category, as well as the micro average across all 2,069 label assignments and 332 files, since the dataset is imbalanced.

4.4.3. Findings.
Automatic classification of agent context files is feasible and promising, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.79.
As shown in Table 4 , the model performs particularly well on concrete, functional instructions in the Implementation, Build, and Management categories. Labels such as System Overview , Architecture , and Testing achieve high F1-scores, indicating that instructions in these areas are distinct and consistently expressed, which allows the model to recognize their patterns reliably. Build and Run , Implementation Details , and Development Process also exhibit strong performance.
In contrast, the model struggles with categories that are more abstract or have semantically overlapping or sparsely represented examples. Within the Quality and General categories, labels such as Maintenance , Project Management , AI Integration , and Documentation and References obtain comparatively lower F1-scores. This suggests that, while the model is effective at detecting concrete commands and technical structures, it has more difficulty distinguishing nuanced or infrequent instructions related to project management or maintainability.
5. Implications
In this section, we discuss the implications of our findings for researchers, developers, and coding agent builders.
5.1. Implications for researchers
Define and measure context debt as a new form of technical debt.
Our analysis in Section 4.1 shows that agent context files are not merely configuration files but extensive documentation artifacts. In particular, Claude Code files exhibit a median Flesch reading ease (FRE) score of 16.6, which classifies them as very difficult to read and comparable to dense legal contracts or academic papers. This low readability, combined with their considerable length, suggests that as projects evolve, these context files accumulate context debt: a state where instructions meant to clarify context for an AI agent become unmaintainable and opaque to human collaborators. This creates a paradox where a mechanism designed to align agents increases the cognitive load on developers. Future work should formalize context debt by identifying specific context file smells ( e.g., ambiguous directives, conflicting role definitions) and by developing metrics beyond standard readability scores to assess the maintainability of agent instructions.
Model the co-evolution of agent context files and code to automate maintenance.
Contrary to the write-once nature of traditional READMEs (Gaughan et al., 2025 ) , our findings in Section 4.2 show that agent context files are actively maintained, with 67.4% of Claude Code files undergoing multiple modifications. These updates often occur in short bursts and involve incremental additions rather than deletions. This active evolution indicates a tight coupling between context files and the underlying codebase. When code is refactored, related instructions in the context file ( e.g., Build and Run commands) risk becoming outdated. Researchers should study this co-evolutionary relationship to develop CI-integrated tools that automatically detect divergences. For example, researchers can design a linter for agent context files which could verify that the commands listed in the Build and Run section (62.3% prevalence) match the actual scripts in package.json or Makefile , which would reduce the manual effort required for synchronization.
Investigate the blind spots of agentic coding and build related benchmarks.
Our content analysis (Section 4.3 ) highlights a critical gap: while functional categories like Build and Run and Implementation Details dominate, non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as Security (14.5%) and Performance (14.5%) are notably rare. This suggests that agents are currently conditioned to prioritize functionality over quality attributes. If benchmarks ( e.g., SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024 ) ) do not penalize agents for generating insecure or inefficient code, this blind spot will persist. The research community should design new benchmarks or evaluation frameworks that explicitly test an agent’s adherence to NFRs defined in agent context files. Tasks should require agents to pass unit tests and comply with security constraints and architectural patterns specified in the context file.
5.2. Implications for developers
Adopt a configuration-as-code mindset for agent context files.
The active maintenance patterns observed in Section 4.2 indicate that agent context files behave more like dynamic configurations than static text. Developers should therefore treat files like CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md with the same rigor applied to Dockerfile or CI/CD workflows. We recommend integrating context file updates into the standard code review process. When a Pull Request modifies the build system or refactors a core module, the review checklist should explicitly ask whether the change requires an update to the agent context files. Treating these files as living code artifacts prevents context drift and keeps the agent’s operational knowledge aligned with the current state of the project.
Explicitly include non-functional requirements (NFRs) to prevent quality degradation.
The scarcity of instructions related to Security and Performance (Section 4.3 ) serves as a warning. Unlike human senior developers who may implicitly understand secure coding practices, AI agents rely heavily on explicit context. If security guidelines are absent from the context file, agents may produce functional yet vulnerable code ( e.g., SQL injection risks). Developers should proactively structure their agent context files to include mandatory sections for NFRs. Directives such as “All database interactions must use parameterized queries” or “Do not commit secrets” should be codified within the context file to act as continuous guardrails during generation.
Implement versioning and governance for agent context files evolution.
Given that agent context files grow through frequent, small additions (Section 4.2 ), they risk becoming unstructured append-only logs. To address this, developers should apply semantic versioning to their context files and maintain a changelog. Because agents may misinterpret instructions, changes to high-impact sections like Architecture or Development Process should require approval from a designated context owner via CODEOWNERS , 22 22 22 https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners ensuring that the agent’s behavioral guidelines remain consistent and authoritative.
5.3. Implications for coding agent builders
Leverage structural consistency for scaffolded authoring tools.
Our structural analysis in Section 4.1 shows that agent context files follow a consistent, shallow hierarchy based on H1 and H2 headers. Tool builders can use this pattern to lower the barrier to entry for developers. Instead of presenting an empty text editor, IDEs and agent interfaces should provide templated scaffolds pre-populated with the common categories identified in Section 4.3 ( e.g., Build and Run , Implementation Details , Testing ). These templates should also include placeholders for frequently neglected NFR categories ( Security , Performance ), which would encourage more comprehensive documentation.
Optimize context retrieval using semantic categorization.
The categorization of instructions (Table 3 in Section 4.3 ) indicates that agent context files contain distinct clusters of information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for coding agents should move beyond naive text chunking and use this semantic structure. When an agent is tasked with fixing a bug, for example, retrieval should prioritize sections labeled Debugging (24.4%) and Testing , while deprioritizing unrelated sections like DevOps . By parsing the hierarchy of context file, agent builders can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the context supplied to the LLM, which should lead to more accurate and relevant code generation.
6. Related Work
In this section, we discuss related work about AI agents in software engineering, software documentation, and context engineering.
6.1. AI agents in software engineering
AI in software development is shifting from single-turn code completion to agentic software engineering (Hassan et al., 2025 ) . In this paradigm, agents understand high-level goals, produce plans, and execute multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention (Wang et al., 2024 ; Bouzenia et al., 2024 ; Schick et al., 2023 ; Bubeck et al., 2023 ) . These agents combine an LLM-based reasoning core with memory, planning modules, and tool use, such as interacting with IDEs, running tests, and invoking external services (Feldt et al., 2023 ; Mialon et al., 2023 ) . This reframes LLMs from autocomplete engines into components within larger systems that must be configured, orchestrated, and maintained (Jin et al., 2024 ; Xu et al., 2022 ) . Architectures are converging on perception, memory, and action patterns, where agents ingest context, ground decisions in persistent memory, and act through tool APIs (Wang et al., 2024 ) .
Research has expanded from simple code generation to agents that can interactively clarify ambiguous requirements (Mu et al., 2024 ; Endres et al., 2023 ; Wu and Fard, 2025 ) , refactor code (Alomar et al., 2024 ; Horikawa et al., 2025 ) , and assess code quality (Yedida and Menzies, 2022 ) . Collaboration mechanisms further boost effectiveness. For example, multi-agent pair programming splits strategic planning and tactical coding across coordinated roles, such as Navigator and Driver agents (Zhang et al., 2024a ) , and scalable human-in-the-loop frameworks that keep developers in control of plans and reviews while letting agents draft and iterate code (Pasuksmit et al., 2025 ; Takerngsaksiri et al., 2024 ) . Existing studies primarily focus on the agent’s internal architecture and collaborative behavior, that is, how the agents reason and coordinate, rather than how they are configured from the outside.
Automatic program repair (APR) has been an early beneficiary of this paradigm. Base LLMs already rival or surpass traditional APR pipelines on several benchmarks (Xia et al., 2022 ; Fan et al., 2022 ; Goues et al., 2019 ) , while agentized repair further improves reliability by iterating between code changes, test execution, and analysis (Bouzenia et al., 2024 ) . Related work integrates specification extraction and formal feedback into the loop so that agents can better infer intent and refine patches (Ruan et al., 2024 ; Endres et al., 2023 ; Mu et al., 2024 ) . Beyond repair and generation, agents have been proposed for autonomous testing (Feldt et al., 2023 ) and code quality support, such as detecting smells and providing maintainability guidance (Yedida and Menzies, 2022 ) .
With greater integration comes new failure modes. Empirical studies report integration defects and security risks across agent, vector store, connector, and execution layers (Shao et al., 2024 ) . For example, model context protocol (MCP) helps agents to integrate tools but introduces security risks (Hasan et al., 2025 ) . At the same time, evaluating agents remains costly and variable. Comprehensive test-based assessments are expensive, while LLM-as-a-judge evaluations can be inconsistent. Real-world utilization depends on collaboration patterns and process fit (Pasuksmit et al., 2025 ; Takerngsaksiri et al., 2024 ; Suri et al., 2023 ) . These observations highlight the need for reliable artifacts and practices that communicate project-specific constraints to agents and keep behavior aligned over time.
Our work targets this missing layer: persistent configuration and context artifacts that steer agent behavior in real-world projects. Prior work optimizes models, tools, and workflows, and studies the agent’s internal architecture and coordination. In contrast, we study the documents that operationalize those workflows from the outside, namely agent context files such as CLAUDE.md , AGENTS.md , and copilot-instructions.md files. While augmented language model designs advocate external tools, memory, and retrieval to ground decisions (Mialon et al., 2023 ) , the community lacks a systematic understanding of how open-source projects encode roles, constraints, build and test routines, and conventions for agents at scale. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis of these manifests, quantifying their structure, maintenance, and instruction taxonomies, and complementing existing work with evidence about the project-level artifacts.
6.2. Software documentation
Empirical research on software documentation spans a wide range of artifacts, such as READMEs, API documentation, issue discussions, and release notes. Prior studies found that README files are typically concise and function-focused, often expanding over time (Gaughan et al., 2025 ) . Over 90% of READMEs mention basic information such as project name, description, and usage instructions (Prana et al., 2019 ) . Large-scale repository mining has uncovered recurring documentation issues and antipatterns in APIs (Aghajani et al., 2018 ) , fragmented feature documentation in popular GitHub projects (Puhlfurss et al., 2022 ) , and how refactoring needs and improvement activities are described and tracked through issues (Alomar et al., 2022 ) . Surveys and interviews further identify what practitioners value and which issues they consider most critical (Aghajani et al., 2020 ; Alsuhaibani et al., 2021 ) .
Researchers have reported documentation issues found in software projects (Aghajani et al., 2019 ) , but evaluating documentation quality remains challenging. Automatic metrics adapted from machine translation and summarization, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, are widely used to assess generated comments and summaries (Mastropaolo et al., 2023 ; Rai et al., 2022 ; Guo et al., 2023 ) . However, several studies show that improvements in these metrics often fail to align with human-perceived usefulness, with only moderate correlations and even ranking inversions relative to practitioner judgments (Roy et al., 2021 ; Kruse et al., 2024 ; Stapleton et al., 2020 ) .
Beyond static quality, research also examines how documentation evolves. Studies on code-comment co-evolution show frequent inconsistencies (Wen et al., 2019 ) , and techniques have been developed to detect outdated or contradictory statements in API documentation and narratives (Tan et al., 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ) . Dynamic and hybrid approaches leverage runtime values or execution traces to generate or validate documentation, showing benefits for specific method categories (Sulír and Porubän, 2017 ; Sulír, 2018 ) . Recent datasets explicitly target code-documentation alignment during maintenance, underscoring that synchronization remains a persistent challenge (Pai et al., 2025 ) .
Documentation concerns also surface in code review. Large-scale analyses show that reviewers routinely discuss, request, and amend documentation, making review a key gatekeeper for documentation quality (Rao et al., 2022 ) . Automated assistance increasingly participates in this process: review bots influence project throughput and communication patterns (Wessel et al., 2020 ) , and specialized frameworks detect and repair defects in API directives, including parameters and exceptions, with high precision (Zhou et al., 2020 ) .
Prior work has primarily investigated documentation written by developers for developers, focusing on its quality, evolution, and automation. In contrast, we study agent-facing, persistent configuration artifacts (agent context files) that encode project context, roles, and operating rules for coding agents. To our knowledge, such manifests have not been examined at scale in the documentation literature cited above.
6.3. Context engineering
A growing body of work investigates context engineering, which extends beyond traditional prompt engineering to optimize how developers provide information to AI coding agents. While prompt engineering typically optimizes transient, task-level interactions, context engineering concerns persistent artifacts such as configuration files, documentation, and contextual instructions that continuously shape agent behavior across sessions and projects. Researchers are empirically examining how different instruction strategies affect agent performance on diverse software engineering tasks, including code generation (Shin et al., 2023 ) , automated program repair (Xia et al., 2022 ; Ye and Martin, 2023 ) , and repository-level code completion (Shrivastava et al., 2022 ) .
This research can be broadly divided into two complementary areas: (a) the study of immediate, task-specific prompts, and (b) the study of persistent, project-level context. Much of the existing literature focuses on optimizing the immediate instructions that developers provide for specific, in-the-moment tasks. These include reasoning-oriented techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) for multi-step tasks (Peng et al., 2023 ) , interactive methods involving reflection and dialogue (Zhang et al., 2024c ; Mondal et al., 2024 ) , and analyses of recurring patterns in developers’ conversational prompts (Kumar et al., 2025 ) . Other studies examine knowledge-enriched prompts that embed domain-specific data, such as UML model constraints (Abukhalaf et al., 2023 ) or exception handling patterns (Ren et al., 2023 ) , to produce more robust and reliable outputs.
Complementing this, other work highlights that a primary failure mode for AI assistants is a fundamental “lack of contextual awareness” (Akhoroz and Yildirim, 2025 ; Tufano et al., 2024 ) , a problem that cannot be solved by a single prompt alone. This challenge has driven the development of mechanisms that provide agents with persistent, repository-level context (Hai et al., 2025 ; Shrivastava et al., 2022 ) . These context-rich approaches integrate repository-level information such as imports, module hierarchies, or architectural metadata to improve code completion and adaptation (Gao et al., 2024 ; Shrivastava et al., 2022 ) . Studies consistently show that such fine-grained, knowledge-driven context yields substantial improvements in code quality, correctness, and reliability over simple zero-shot prompts (Shin et al., 2023 ; Abukhalaf et al., 2023 ; Nashid et al., 2023 ) . As providing this context becomes a core development activity, managing these instructions as long-lived artifacts has emerged as a new software engineering challenge (Li et al., 2025a ) .
While prior studies have explored the effects of providing repository-level context (Shrivastava et al., 2022 ; Gao et al., 2024 ) or the content of conversational prompts (Kumar et al., 2025 ) , the artifacts that developers create to manage this persistent context remain unexamined. This paper presents the first empirical study of agent manifests ( e.g., CLAUDE.md , AGENTS.md ) as key artifacts of context engineering, analyzing their structure, content, and maintenance patterns to understand how developers curate the persistent instructions that guide agentic coding in practice.
7. Threats to Validity
In this section, we discuss the threats to validity of our study about agent context files.
7.1. Internal Validity
Threats to internal validity concern factors internal to our study that could have influenced our results. Section 4.3 involves manual classification of content within the agent context files, which introduces potential human error and subjective bias. To address this risk, two inspectors examined the agent context files independently and carefully. This independent labeling achieved 80.3% agreement, and a third inspector resolved any conflicting labels.
7.2. Construct Validity
Threats to construct validity concern the extent to which the measures used truly reflect the concepts being studied. Our manual content classification approach categorized instructions into 16 distinct labels based on the presence of a topic. For instance, the category Implementation Details encompasses specific guidance for implementing code or system components, including coding style guidelines. The threat arises because this classification was purely binary; an agent context file was flagged with the Implementation Details label if it contained any mention of code style, regardless of whether that content was minimal (one line of instruction) or substantial (many lines detailing complex conventions). Consequently, the frequency reported for a category represents only the prevalence of the topic, not the depth, complexity, or qualitative richness that developers invested in that specific instruction set.
7.3. External Validity
Threats to external validity concern the generalizability of our findings. This study examined 2,303 agent context files from 1,925 repositories that use one of three major agentic coding systems ( i.e., Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot). Although we expanded the number of studied files compared to our previous study (Chatlatanagulchai et al., 2025 ) , the dataset remains limited, which constrains the generalizability of our findings. Future work should extend this analysis to include a larger number of files from various agentic coding systems.
8. Conclusion
This study presented the first empirical analysis of the structure, maintenance, and content of agent context files, such as CLAUDE.md , AGENTS.md , and copilot-instructions.md , which play an important role in defining and operationalizing AI agent behavior in agentic coding. The primary motivation for this research was the significant lack of accessible documentation for creating these manifest files, which has historically forced developers into inefficient trial-and-error approaches when configuring their agents. Our investigation systematically analyzed 2,303 context files collected from 1,925 open-source repositories to provide an empirical foundation for best practices.
Our findings regarding the characteristics of agent context files reveal that these files are generally long and difficult to read. Additionally, such files for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are substantially longer than those for OpenAI Codex, suggesting developers provide a much larger volume of natural language instruction to these agents. Critically, the readability of these files is poor; the documents are complex, with many categorized as “very difficult” category typically associated with dense academic or legal documents. Structurally, manifests are consistently organized with a shallow hierarchy, anchored by a single H1 heading and using H2 and H3 subsections to define major topics, a pattern that likely aids developers in quickly parsing and maintaining the documents. Furthermore, unlike conventional software documentation often characterized as “write-once,” agent context files are actively maintained, behaving as evolving configuration artifacts. The majority of Claude Code manifests (67.4%) are revisited and refined across multiple commits, with maintenance occurring in short, rapid bursts. This evolution is driven by small, incremental content additions, while content deletions are negligible.
The analysis of instructional content demonstrated that developers primarily focus on action-oriented, functional guidance necessary for execution and maintenance. The most prevalent instructions address practical operations, including Build and Run (62.3%), Implementation Details (69.9%), and Architecture (67.7%). However, the study identified critical omissions: instructions addressing non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as Security (14.5%), Performance (14.5%), and UI/UX (8.7%), were notably infrequent. This suggests that agents are extensively guided on “how” to build the code functionally, but not necessarily on “how to build it well” concerning quality attributes.
